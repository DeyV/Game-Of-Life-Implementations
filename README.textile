h1. Multi-language implementations of Conway's Game of Life

The goal of this project is to provide near identical implementations of "Conway's Game of Life":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life in an effort to learn and add new languages, and get a rough idea of the syntax and runtime speed of each language.

I started with the Ruby implementation, optimized it as much as I could, and then ported it to the other languages. Therefore, some languages may not run as fast as they possibly could. Any suggestions for general optimizations that can be applied to all implementations are greatly appreciated.

h2. Speed Results (by tick time)

*Note 1:* These speed results are taken on a Macbook Pro 15" Retina (Mid 2014), 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7, with 16 GB of 1600 MHz DDR3 RAM.

*Note 2:* The times were calculated by playing each simulation for a few thousand ticks until the tick average stabilized.
